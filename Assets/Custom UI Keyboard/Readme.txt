Hey friend :)
Thanks for buying my asset!



In my asset you will find the Best UI keyboard you can find on Internet!!
You can fully customize it, change everything from colors to keys order...
Plus, you can use it in VR with a few changes.
My asset works with TMP_InputField and I'm STRONGLY ADVISE you to use TMP text and InputField!!!



How to use it:

There are two scenes - they are similar, but one contains a PC like keyboard
and second is a Phone like keyboard so I would tell about one of them. 
For instance, scene SampleScene:

Here you will find a keyboard, test buttons for change themes, 2 template input fields, one is single line type, 
second one is a multiple line type. 
First, you need to add tags for keyboard, for instance Standart, Numeric, Decimal, etc. It needs because
you can customize the keyboard and create ANY type of the keyboard (I show the process on asset store page) and we need
to know which keyboard we need to use for each input field.
To make input fields work with my asset - just add the InputFieldScript component to your input field.
In inspector you need to enter tag name of the keyboard.
Then you need to add a Keyboard prefab to your scene and set a tag to it.
That's all!! You can use a keyboard now!

To find out how to customize the keyboard you can watch the videos on asset store.

To find more information about settings or you don't want to watch the videos - my code is fully commented and it won't
be a problem for you to modify it and read it.
